# Homemade kernel

This is a recreational project.

## Install toolchain

Execute `./scripts/init_toolchain.sh` at the root of the project : it will download the cross-compiler in the folder toolchain/.

> You must do that or modify the Makefile to build the project.

## Build

You only need to run :

```sh
make build-x86
```
